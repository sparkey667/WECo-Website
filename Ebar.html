    Our campus hosts a rich community of thinkers, designers and builders that
strive to live by the simple goal of creating. This era of making has inspired us to be
involved in the development of our education and to inspire others to share the same
ideals. We are dedicated to the process of creation and building and it is from that
dedication that this project has sprouted. Our goal is to create a communal environment
that allows students to both socialize and collaborate. An environment that enables
students to participate in the wonderful community that Wentworth has established. An
environment that perpetuates the ideals Wentworth was founded upon, Honesty,
Energy, Economy and System. This structure, designed to embody sustainable methods
of construction and local resources, has utilized a powerful concept of EPIC
collaboration in the hopes that with the input of not just one student, not just one
major, and not just one organization but a community of them all will produce both a
fully developed product, and the community that we wish to learn and develop in. This
project aspires to affect both the immediate and the long-term environment, by being a
modular system that can adapt to better and bigger ideas that we hope to inspire in
other students. Lastly, we hope to have this project branch the gap between our very
own majors taught here at Wentworth and our fellow COF communities by creating this
system that allows the construction of it to be studied and taught to others as an
opportunity to learn and grow from the creations we build.
