      <p class=" w3-padding w3-padding-4 w3-mobile">Earth Hour is a charitable event that started in Sydney Australiaâ€™s in 2007 that happens every year on March 25th from 8:30pm to 9:30pm. It is an open source movement by the WWF and volunteer organizations worldwide. Since 2007, the movement has grown to 172 countries and territories worldwide participants. </p>
      <p class=" w3-padding w3-padding-4 w3-mobile">The Wentworth Environmental Collaborative teamed up with The Wentworth Sustainability to participate in the world wide. Our goal for Earth Hour was to target the hour of 8:30 to 9:30pm on Saturday March 25th to see if we could have electricity demand like that of the typical early morning. Since 2017 was the first year participating in the event, the team decided to start off with a sample population, Baker Residence Hall, to show how Earth Hour could affect the whole campus for future years. </p>
      <p class=" w3-padding w3-padding-4 w3-mobile">Prior to the event, we put up signs throughout Baker Hall asking students to turn off their lights, unplug their TV's ad computers, and use as little electricity as possible. In return, the students would be able to have pizza and the chance to win some prizes. We recorded data to the week prior to Earth Hour in order to see if there were any drastic changes in energy consumption </p>

      <p class=" w3-padding w3-padding-4 w3-mobile w3-center ">Shown here is the electricity demand on a normal Saturday. This is the previous Saturday, March 18. Again, the peak electricity demand times are late night around midnight, with steep decreases after 1:00am. On this day, the highest electricity demand was at 7:45pm, clocking in at 28.50kw of electricity. The lowest demand point was at 8:00am, with 14.25kw of electricity.</p>

 We had a total of 80 people participate, because we a total of 80 lamps were given out that night. Baker Hall houses about 320 students, meaning we only reached around 25% of the residents. The numbers do not reflect a 25% decrease in electricity demand. For example, the low point of our test at 8:40 is only 1.94Kw less than that of the same time as the week before. On Saturday, March 18, at 8:40, the electricity demand was 24.38Kw. This is about a 7% decrease in electricity demand, at that point in time. The demand did increase upwards after that. While behavior change programs typically show a 3-10% reduction in unsafe, there is not sufficient evidence showing that this was true for the entirety of the event.
    </p>
    <p class=" w3-padding w3-padding-4 w3-mobile">
   Pictured below is the electricity usage during the hours of 8:00pm to 10:00pm on the two Saturdays. Again, we are comparing Earth Hour to the previous Saturday. Notice here that the electricity usage was greater than that of the previous week in some spots, and for the most part increases over time. For the previous Saturday, the total kwh consumed between 8pm-10pm was 51.21kwh while during Earth Hour the electricity consumed was 51.41kwh.

 One can conclude that after taking pizza and lamps, students simply turned back on their lights and continued with their evenings. However, given the genuine interest displayed bu the vas majority of the participants, this is not true. Initially a drop in energy demand, which are on par with what is to be expected, but that did not last for the duration of the event. The lesson learned here is that there is a huge interest in sustainability amongs the residents. THis was a good trial run, and both WECo and Wentworth Sutainability have a good template to go from for Earth Hour 2018.
