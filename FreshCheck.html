         Fresh Check Day day is an event that Wellness Education puts on every semester. It is unique in that it has a fair-like feel to it. This makes it particularly engaging because not only are the activities fun (and peer-to-peer led) but students can enter to win prizes at the event of the event. We give the event a "fair-like" feel by setting up booths (each with their own educational objective and activity). When students first arrive at FCD, they report to the registration booth. At the registration booth, they are given a passport card (see attached). Each booth has a corresponding number that goes with it. When students participate in a booth's activity, then the booth facilitator will stamp their passport card in their respective spot. Once students get 5 stamps, they can turn their passport cards in to enter the raffle

          Fresh Check Day is held twice each semester. The fall event is held on the quad and usually has really high attendance (last year we had 370 students come through). The spring event is a bit smaller but still pretty mighty. Last spring we had 150 students come through. Fresh Check Day is held on Tuesdays at lunchtime because that's typically when most students have breaks in their schedules! Here's to hoping they all stop by Fresh Check Day this semester!

        One of the objectives of Fresh Check Day is to give students ideas on how to better cope with their stress. Healthy and productive coping skills reduce stress and protective individuals from mental health concerns like anxiety, depression and suicide because they give them an outlet to manage their feelings.

	 Gardening has been proven to relieve stress for some of the following reasons: 
     <b>(source: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/worry-and-panic/201505/petal-power-why-is-gardening-so-good-our-mental-health)</b>
<li>Looking after plants gives us a sense of responsibility</li>
<li>Gardening allows us all to be nurturers.</li>
<li>Gardening keeps us connected to other living things.</li>
<li>Being in touch with nature and the great outdoors can help you feel more removed from the stressors of daily life.</li>
<li>Gardening helps us relax and let go.</li>
<li>Working in nature releases happy hormones</li>
<li>To say that gardening encourages us to exercise and spend time outdoors might seem a statement of the obvious, but it’s worth reminding ourselves that what’s good for the body is also good for the mind. When we exercise levels of serotonin and dopamine (hormones that make us feel good) rise and the level of cortisol (a hormone associated with stress), is lowered.</li>
<li>Being amongst plants and flowers reminds us to live in the present moment.</li>
 <li>Gardening can allow us to feel in control</li>

           After the talking points are reviewed with students, WECo members will instruct students to begin gardening. Once you let me know what materials you need for that, it will be all set for you at the table. I will buy for 100-120 students to participate. This part is certainly WECo's area of expertise so I will divert to you on how to go about planting the seeds. I can also provide markers and such so that people can decorate their biodegradable pots, what do you think? Once a student has planted a seed, a WECo volunteer can stamp their passport card.
